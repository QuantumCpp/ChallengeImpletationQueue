Queue Implementation in C++

A simple and educational implementation of a FIFO Queue using pointers and dynamic memory in C++.
This project demonstrates how a queue works internally without using STL containers, making it ideal for learning pointer manipulation and linked structures.

🚀 Features

Node-based queue using a custom Nodo struct

Manual memory management (new / delete)

Pointer references to front and rear

Full queue operations:

enqueue(int) – Add an element

dequeue() – Remove the front element

peak() – View the front value

showAll() – Print all elements

deleteAll() – Clear the queue

isEmpty() – Check if the queue is empty

Automatic cleanup in the destructor

Safe pointer handling

🎯 Purpose

This project was created as a personal learning exercise to better understand:

pointers

dynamic memory

linked list behavior

object lifecycle in C++

queue algorithms without STL

🔮 Future Improvements

Template-based generic queue (Queue<T>)

Exception handling

Unit tests

Circular queue version

Interactive menu with user input
